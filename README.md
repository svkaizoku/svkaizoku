# Hey there, I'm Vignesh 👋

## About Me 🤖

I'm just your friendly neighborhood developer, a coding enthusiast by day and a Netflix binger by night. I have an insatiable appetite for problem-solving and love to create things that make people go "wow"! When I'm not busy staring at my screen, you can find me sipping coffee ☕️ 

## Tech Stack 🚀

- ⌨️ Kotlin, Java.
- 📦 Veu.js for all things web.
- 🐍 Machine Learning and AI to make the robots take over.
- 🚀 DevOps tools to deploy to the moon (NASA, are you hiring?)

## Current Project: Time Machine ⏰

I'm secretly building a time machine to fix all those bugs I introduced into production. But shh, it's a top-secret project, so don't tell anyone! 🤫

## Fun Facts 🎈

- I can speak in 6 different programming languages, but only to computers.
- My code is like my coffee – full of bugs in the morning, but it gets better as the day goes on.
- I love attending tech-meetups, mainly for the free stickers!
